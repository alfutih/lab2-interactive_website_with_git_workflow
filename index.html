            <h1 class="Welcome">Welcome to my portfolio. <br>
            My name is Tarek Alfutih, I am an interaction designer and illustrator.</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="under_welcome_text">When I was little, I had a strong passion for drawing-a passion that grew with me throughout my youth and eventually led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts, specializing in Visual Communication.
                Over 10 years as an illustrator, I've brought over 20 children's books to life through my illustrations and design, collaborating closely with authors and publishing houses. 
                My work also includes teaching materials and other creative projects, all driven by a love for storytelling and visual communication.<br><br>
                This passion has led me to explore new directions. I'm now studying for a master's in Interaction Design at Chalmers. 
                Here, I'm learning about user experience (UX), user interface (UI), interaction design, and prototyping. 
                My goal is to combine my artistic skills with human-centered design to create solutions for both digital and physical experiences—like products, tools, and systems that improve how people interact with their environment.<br><br>
                I aspire to work as an interaction designer, UX/UI designer, or UX researcher, using creativity and problem-solving to enhance user experiences. Let's connect to collaborate or share ideas on design and innovation!
